§ 125-15 Zoning districts.
A.
For the purposes of this chapter, the Town of Rhinebeck hereby establishes and divides the Town into the following zoning districts as illustrated on the Town of Rhinebeck Zoning Map.[1] The intent of the zoning districts is to guide both the conservation and development of the Town's land and water resources in harmony with the Town Comprehensive Plan, the Dutchess County Plan Directions, the Hudson River Valley Greenway Compact guidelines Greenway Connections, including consistency with the objectives of the Town's National Historic Landmark District and Local Waterfront Revitalization Program (LWRP), the Mid-Hudson Historic Shorelands Scenic District Management Plan and scenic roads programs, and any locally or state-designated protected resources and critical environmental areas. In addition to the zoning districts, this chapter also establishes overlay districts, which add additional requirements to protect identified natural and cultural resources or to encourage specific types of development. Small-scale housing developments for senior citizens have been addressed by this chapter through a floating zone, which is established through the zoning amendment process. The zoning districts are listed in tabular form as follows and are more explicitly described below that. Maps identifying the zoning districts can be found at the end of this article.
